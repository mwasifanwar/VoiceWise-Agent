# AI Voice Agent

This AI Voice Agent project uses Python and advanced natural language processing techniques to simulate a voice agent. The agent can handle complex queries and provide responses based on predefined rules and configurations.

## Features

- Handle inbound and outbound voice-based queries.
- Provide responses based on predefined rules and intent recognition.
- Logging for all interactions.
- Configurable settings for easy customization.

Usage
The voice agent is set up to handle complex voice interactions. You can extend the functionality by modifying the responses dictionary in conversation/response_generator.py.
